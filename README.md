# fitns - designed and developed by Cameron Conway

The focus of this project was to design and build a modern online store application with a clean and user friendly interface. I have dealt with state using the Context API.

## Technologies

The project is built using the frontend JavaScript library [React](https://reactjs.org/) along with TypeScript, styling is dealt with using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
